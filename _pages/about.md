We are Open Source Lab @ NAU! Our focus is on making Open Source a better place for everybody, creating a welcoming, inclusive and sustainable environment in which projects and developers live in a symbiotic way.

NAU-OSL main focus is on supporting the onboarding of newcomers to Open Source projects. For almost 10 years, we have been investigating barriers and challenges that may hinder newcomers to contribute. We proposed a set of tools and guidelines that may help both newcomers and communities.

Most recently, we have been focusing on understanding Open Research Software, in order to better support this specific kind of project in terms of inclusivity, attractiveness, and sustainability. We are putting together multiple ideas that will build upon existing tools and to create new ones that may offer support to different aspects of onboarding these projects. Ou focus is moving to research software since they are usually maintained by researchers with no extensive knowledge in open source or software development, and the potential contributors are generally from other domains (e.g., bioinformatics, ecoinformatics).
We believe that by offering the right tooling to the Principal Investigators (to help them providing information about how to create an inclusive project) and to newcomers (to help them with a clear picture of the project, and how to find the appropriate information) we can make scientific software welcoming and sustainable.
