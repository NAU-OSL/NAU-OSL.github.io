## [Gender-inclusive open source](http://gendermag.org/gm_OSS.html)

This is a research project aims to investigate how open source software tools and technologies have gender biases tied with diverse problem-solving styles, and how to remove any such biases.

Our goal is to develop guidelines and propose tools to make OSS infrastructure (forges, issue trackers, etc.) less biased towards specific cognitive styles.
