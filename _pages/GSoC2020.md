[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3-month programming project during their break from school.

If you want to develop Open Source, have a real experience with software projects, and wants to help people that want to join Open Source, join us! If you are a student, and is motivated, come! Do not worry if you do not have developed open source  before. We will guide you towards the process and technology. We strongly recommend to have a prior contact with our team via slack or e-mail so we can introduce you to our tools and projects. 

We are  looking for students who want to learn, help, and have good coding skills. One important thing here is: you must be willing to contribute and learn about open source and its aspects.

### How to Apply

Your application needs to cover four important aspects: (i) identify the goals of your projects and ideas to develop it; (ii)  convince us that you are the right student to do that; (iii) indicate a high-level schedule comprising the 12 weeks of GSoC (including learning outcomes and deliverables); and (iv) show how your project can be expanded or maintained after GSoC is over.

We welcome applications that build upon our initial ideas, but also welcome **new ideas** related to the tools that we develop and the goal of our lab. Go ahead and learn about what we do, and focus on selling your ideas

The application process is the opportunity to introduce yourself, show your skills and motivations, and to understand how you will get involved and will get the task done. Showing that you spent time understanding the tasks and the strategies to overcome the problems presented is recommended. We do not expect the applications to be perfect, or conceived by the applicant only. We want to explore the ideas and potentials. The goal is to have a win-win relationship, with outcomes for the project and outstanding learning opportunities for the students.

It is perfectly fine to ask for ideas and to discuss with our team in our mailing lists. However, do not expect us to review your application before the submission. We can discsuss ideas.


## Our IDEAS
### Browser plugin to make GitHub more newcomer friendly


### Automatically feed FLOSScoach with data collected from OSS projects documentation (Doc4Newcomers)


## NewcomerBot

Create a bot that consumes information from FLOSScoach and interacts with newcomers in a conversational way


### Infrastructure to intermediate the interaction between Open Source Research projects and students/instructors

Idea of creating a repository for PIs to add their projects that need technical people.
This repo would help instructors teaching Open Source courses and students taking these courses. Instructors and students often 
struggle to find projects to contribute as part of their coursework. By providing such kind of repository, 
students would be offering their contributions to benefit already existing research software projects that need 
sofwtare development expertise. The projects, would offer support related to the business domain, guiding the newcomers.
This ultimately is a win-win interaction, which may strongly affect the research projects' sustainability, and will
help students to build a strong portfolio, and put them in touch with research teams.


### Bug fixing for FLOSScoach
