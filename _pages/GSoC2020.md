In this idea we summarize the ideas for GSoC 2020.

## Browser plugin to make GitHub more newcomer friendly


## Automatically feed FLOSScoach with data collected from OSS projects documentation (Doc4Newcomers)


## NewcomerBot

Create a bot that consumes information from FLOSScoach and interacts with newcomers in a conversational way


## Infrastructure to intermediate the interaction between Open Source Research projects and students/instructors

Idea of creating a repository for PIs to add their projects that need technical people.
This repo would help instructors teaching Open Source courses and students taking these courses. Instructors and students often 
struggle to find projects to contribute as part of their coursework. By providing such kind of repository, 
students would be offering their contributions to benefit already existing research software projects that need 
sofwtare development expertise. The projects, would offer support related to the business domain, guiding the newcomers.
This ultimately is a win-win interaction, which may strongly affect the research projects' sustainability, and will
help students to build a strong portfolio, and put them in touch with research teams.


## Bug fixing for FLOSScoach
